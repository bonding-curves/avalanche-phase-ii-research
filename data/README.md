# Research data

This directory defines the machine-readable contracts for research data used in Avalanche Phase II. The first dataset reconstructs Snowpeer's six network-wide summary metrics. The others preserve every validator staking transaction, every delegation transaction, and every staking reward outcome on the Avalanche Primary Network from the Avalanche Snowflake share. All of them keep the source evidence, transformation, and validation records required to inspect the result.

## Current coverage

| Dataset | Output | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `snowpeer.network-summary` | One timestamped row in JSON and Parquet | Implemented and tested |
| `snowflake.primary-validator-stakes` | One Parquet row per validator staking transaction since 2020-09-10 | Implemented, tested, and captured live |
| `snowflake.primary-delegator-stakes` | One Parquet row per delegation transaction since 2020-09-10 | Implemented, tested, and captured live |
| `snowflake.primary-staking-rewards` | One Parquet row per reward transaction closing a staking period | Implemented, tested, and captured live |
| `snowflake.primary-staking-supply` | One Parquet row per staking transaction with the block supply context behind its potential reward | Implemented, tested, and captured live |
| `coingecko.avax-market-daily` | One Parquet row per day of AVAX price, market capitalization, volume, log return, and 30-day realized volatility | Implemented, tested, and captured live; public API serves the trailing 365 days only |
| `defillama.avax-price-daily` | One Parquet row per daily AVAX price observation since 2020-09-22 with log return and 30-day realized volatility | Implemented, tested, and captured live |

[`data-catalog.json`](data-catalog.json) records source authority, endpoints, queries, field definitions, units, and derivations. [`data-catalog.schema.json`](data-catalog.schema.json) validates its structure. [`queries/`](queries/) holds the exact SQL text each Snowflake dataset runs. [`research-navigation.json`](research-navigation.json) supports deterministic navigation across the published research.

## Reproduce the Snowpeer summary

Resolve all requests and writes without using the network:

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data fetch snowpeer.network-summary \
  --output data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture \
  --preview
```

Create an immutable raw capture, build the normalized dataset, and verify both:

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data fetch snowpeer.network-summary \
  --output data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture

uv run --locked avalanche data build snowpeer.network-summary \
  --from data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture \
  --output data/runs/snowpeer-example/dataset

uv run --locked avalanche data check snowpeer.network-summary \
  --capture data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture \
  --dataset data/runs/snowpeer-example/dataset
```

The capture contains the original response bytes, URLs, timestamps, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes. The build contains a normalized JSON row, a Parquet table, and a receipt that links both outputs to the source capture. Existing output directories are never overwritten.

Generated captures are working data and are not committed by default. A reviewed study may publish a bounded snapshot when its evidence contract requires one.

## Reproduce the staking transactions and reward outcomes

The Snowflake share requires authorized credentials. Install the optional connector and describe the connection once in the connector's own configuration file, outside the repository:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra snowflake
```

```toml
# ~/.snowflake/connections.toml, file mode 600
[avalanche]
account = "<account identifier>"
user = "<user name>"
authenticator = "SNOWFLAKE_JWT"
private_key_file = "/absolute/path/to/rsa_key.p8"
role = "<role>"
warehouse = "<warehouse>"
database = "AVALANCHE_PRIMARY_NETWORK_DATA"
schema = "PRIMARY"
```

Set `AVALANCHE_SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTION` to use a different connection name. The connector's `SNOWFLAKE_HOME` variable relocates the configuration directory. Credentials never enter captures, receipts, or command output.

Resolve the query, parameters, and writes without connecting:

```bash
uv run --locked --extra snowflake avalanche data fetch snowflake.primary-validator-stakes \
  --output data/runs/validator-stakes-example/capture \
  --preview
```

Capture, build, and check. The optional `--param start=YYYY-MM-DD` and `--param end=YYYY-MM-DD` bound the acceptance timestamp as a half-open UTC window. The defaults cover the full history from the 2020-09-10 genesis through the capture day.

```bash
uv run --locked --extra snowflake avalanche data fetch snowflake.primary-validator-stakes \
  --output data/runs/validator-stakes-example/capture \
  --timeout 120

uv run --locked avalanche data build snowflake.primary-validator-stakes \
  --from data/runs/validator-stakes-example/capture \
  --output data/runs/validator-stakes-example/dataset

uv run --locked avalanche data check snowflake.primary-validator-stakes \
  --capture data/runs/validator-stakes-example/capture \
  --dataset data/runs/validator-stakes-example/dataset
```

The capture contains the exact SQL text, bound parameters, Snowflake query ID, session role, warehouse, database, and schema, the compressed result rows, and their SHA-256 hash. The build loads the compressed capture into DuckDB with declared column types and writes a typed Parquet table plus a receipt with row counts, time coverage, and null counts. The checks run as SQL over the same rows, so datasets with millions of rows build and check in seconds. The check verifies hashes, query text, field types, unique transaction hashes, the acceptance window, time ordering, duration bounds of 14 to 365 days, stake bounds of 2,000 to 3,000,000 AVAX, delegation fee bounds of 2% to 100%, and the staked-UTXO reconciliation of each declared stake weight. Rows without a staked UTXO record are counted in the summary rather than reported as findings, because the stake weight comes from the transaction itself.

The delegator dataset follows the same commands with `snowflake.primary-delegator-stakes`. It is about 120 times larger, so its full-history capture takes minutes rather than seconds; use `--timeout 600` and, when a smaller window is enough, the `--param` dates. Each delegation row names the validator staking transaction whose period contains it, and the check reports any delegation that no validator period on its node contains. The funding address is the address behind the largest share of the staked UTXOs, with the number of funding addresses kept alongside it.

The rewards dataset, `snowflake.primary-staking-rewards`, is the same size as the delegator dataset and follows the same commands. Each row is one reward transaction, linked to its staking period through the reward transaction's metadata, with the realized reward summed from reward UTXOs and the difference from the potential reward recorded as the fee transfer: positive for a validator's delegation fee income, negative for a delegator's fee paid. The check confirms the link, the reward timing, agreement between the rewarded flag and the paid amount, and the fee direction for each side. Rewarded periods with no reward UTXO record in the share are counted in the summary rather than reported as findings, like staked UTXOs that are absent from the other two datasets.

The supply dataset, `snowflake.primary-staking-supply`, records for every staking transaction the Primary Network supply after the previous block and after its own block, plus the in-block deltas from earlier staking additions and unrewarded removals. It exists so the protocol reward formula can be backtested against captured potential rewards without a live connection. Its summary reports how often the provider's block supply change differs from the summed staking deltas; the backtest establishes which supply reading the protocol used in each regime.

Amounts are preserved in nAVAX integers and converted once to AVAX. The delegation fee is preserved in millionths and converted once to a rate. Price observations and outside-option yields are separate datasets that do not exist yet.

## Reproduce the AVAX market observations

The public CoinGecko API needs no credential. It limits historical requests to the trailing 365 days (error code 10012); full history from the 2020 listing requires a paid CoinGecko plan, which this repository does not assume.

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data fetch coingecko.avax-market-daily \
  --output data/runs/avax-market-example/capture

uv run --locked avalanche data build coingecko.avax-market-daily \
  --from data/runs/avax-market-example/capture \
  --output data/runs/avax-market-example/dataset

uv run --locked avalanche data check coingecko.avax-market-daily \
  --capture data/runs/avax-market-example/capture \
  --dataset data/runs/avax-market-example/dataset
```

The capture preserves the raw response bytes and hash. The build aligns prices, market capitalizations, and volumes on their timestamps, keeps the latest partial-day point flagged, and derives daily log returns and annualized 30-day realized volatility. The check verifies unique observations, one-day spacing, partial-day placement, and the volatility window.

Full price history comes from the DefiLlama coins series, which carries CoinGecko lineage (`coingecko:avalanche-2`) and a per-series confidence value. The endpoint returns at most 500 points per request, so the contract declares five fixed 500-day windows from the 2020-09-22 series start; windows past the capture day return only the points that exist. The CoinGecko dataset then serves as a cross-check of the trailing year:

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data fetch defillama.avax-price-daily \
  --output data/runs/avax-price-example/capture

uv run --locked avalanche data build defillama.avax-price-daily \
  --from data/runs/avax-price-example/capture \
  --output data/runs/avax-price-example/dataset

uv run --locked avalanche data check coingecko.avax-market-daily \
  --capture data/runs/avax-market-example/capture \
  --dataset data/runs/avax-market-example/dataset \
  --against data/runs/avax-price-example/dataset
```

The cross-check pairs each CoinGecko midnight observation with the DefiLlama observation nearest that day's start when it lies within three hours, reports the median and maximum relative difference and the days it could not align, and raises a finding for any aligned day beyond 10%.

## Use datasets from a notebook

Notebooks load built datasets by catalog ID. Nothing is fetched on load; the functions read the receipts and Parquet files that `fetch` and `build` wrote under `data/runs/`, verify the Parquet hash against the build receipt, and hand back typed tables.

```python
from avalanche_research import datasets

validators = datasets.load("snowflake.primary-validator-stakes")          # latest built run, pandas DataFrame
receipt = datasets.receipt("snowflake.primary-validator-stakes")          # capture and build receipts of that run
db = datasets.connect()                                                   # DuckDB with one view per built dataset
db.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM delegator_stakes JOIN validator_stakes ON validator_transaction_hash = transaction_hash").fetchone()
```

`datasets.runs(dataset_id)` lists the built runs with capture time and row count; pass `run="<directory name>"` to any call to pin one. View names drop the source prefix and the `primary-` prefix: `validator_stakes`, `delegator_stakes`, `staking_rewards`, `staking_supply`, `avax_market_daily`, `avax_price_daily`, `network_summary`. The same listing is available as `avalanche data runs [dataset_id]`.

Snowpeer is a curated secondary source. Its results are suitable for discovery, dashboard reproduction, and cross-checking. Claims that require raw on-chain evidence must use an authoritative chain or warehouse source such as the Avalanche Snowflake share.
