# Research data

This directory defines the machine-readable contracts for research data used in Avalanche Phase II. The first implemented dataset reconstructs Snowpeer's six network-wide summary metrics while preserving every source response and transformation record required to inspect the result.

## Current coverage

| Dataset | Output | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `snowpeer.network-summary` | One timestamped row in JSON and Parquet | Implemented and tested |

[`data-catalog.json`](data-catalog.json) records source authority, endpoints, field definitions, units, and derivations. [`data-catalog.schema.json`](data-catalog.schema.json) validates its structure. [`research-navigation.json`](research-navigation.json) supports deterministic navigation across the published research.

## Reproduce the Snowpeer summary

Resolve all requests and writes without using the network:

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data fetch snowpeer.network-summary \
  --output data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture \
  --preview
```

Create an immutable raw capture, build the normalized dataset, and verify both:

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data fetch snowpeer.network-summary \
  --output data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture

uv run --locked avalanche data build snowpeer.network-summary \
  --from data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture \
  --output data/runs/snowpeer-example/dataset

uv run --locked avalanche data check snowpeer.network-summary \
  --capture data/runs/snowpeer-example/capture \
  --dataset data/runs/snowpeer-example/dataset
```

The capture contains the original response bytes, URLs, timestamps, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes. The build contains a normalized JSON row, a Parquet table, and a receipt that links both outputs to the source capture. Existing output directories are never overwritten.

Generated captures are working data and are not committed by default. A reviewed study may publish a bounded snapshot when its evidence contract requires one.

## Inspect the contract

```bash
uv run --locked avalanche data list
uv run --locked avalanche data describe snowpeer
uv run --locked avalanche data describe snowpeer.network-summary
uv run --locked avalanche data manifest --json
```

Snowpeer is a curated secondary source. Its results are suitable for discovery, dashboard reproduction, and cross-checking. Claims that require raw on-chain evidence must use an authoritative chain or warehouse source.
